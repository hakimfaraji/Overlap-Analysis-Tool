Project Component: Overlap Analysis Tool Code and Data
Name: Analysis_Code_Tool
Date: [11/30/2025]

=======================================================
1. OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE
=======================================================
This folder contains the complete, self-contained web-based tool and the necessary data files to reproduce the systematic review overlap analysis presented in the main manuscript. The tool is designed to run locally in any standard web browser.

=======================================================
2. FILES IN THIS FOLDER
=======================================================
This folder contains three categories of files: Code, Input Data, and Output Data.

A. CODE FILE (Tool Execution)
-----------------------------
* **Final-Overlap-Analysis-Tool.html**: This single file contains the complete source code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic) required to run the overlap assessment tool. It does not require a web server or internet connection (beyond initial library loads).

B. INPUT DATA (Raw Data for Tool)
---------------------------------
* **Raw data_CSV format_Input to Tool.csv**: This CSV file contains the raw data of primary studies included in the 59 systematic reviews, which is used as input for the overlap tool.
    * **Required Input Format (4 Columns):** The file structure adheres to the following mandatory column headers:
        1.  **Code** (Identifier of the review, e.g., R01)
        2.  **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier of the review article)
        3.  **Title** (Full title of the review article)
        4.  **DOIs/PMIDs/WOS IDs of Included Primary Studies** (A list of identifiers for primary studies, separated by a comma or semicolon).

C. OUTPUT DATA (Final Analysis Results)
---------------------------------------
These three Excel files represent the final numerical and statistical outputs generated by the tool, which are referenced in the Results section of the manuscript. (The tool allows export in XLSX, DOC, and TXT; all outputs here are provided in XLSX format.)
* **Overlap_Matrix_Results.xlsx** (Detailed matrix of study-by-study overlap)
* **Core_Study_List_Results.xlsx** (List of core studies and their frequency/inclusion count)
* **Systematic_Review_Overlap_Statistics.xlsx** (Summary statistics, e.g., total included studies, total overlap measures).

=======================================================
3. INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPRODUCIBILITY (How to Run the Code)
=======================================================
To independently reproduce the overlap analysis results:

1.  **Run the Tool:** Download the **Final-Overlap-Analysis-Tool.html** file and double-click it. It will open automatically in your default web browser.
2.  **Upload Data:** On the tool's interface, use the 'Browse' button to select and upload the input file: **Input_Data_for_Overlap_Tool.csv**.
3.  **Generate Output:** The tool will process the data and display the results. Users can then utilize the export functionality to generate and compare the outputs with the three pre-calculated **Output Data** files provided in this folder.
